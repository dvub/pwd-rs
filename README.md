## Important Notes
1. This project has not been tested or audited professionally for security
2. I abandoned development on this instance of the project as soon as I finished it. In other words, **This version is deprecated**, as I've rewritten and refactored the entire project [here](https://github.com/dvub/passmanrsim).
Taking these into account, please do not use this project for any sensitive information. **I am not responsible for any damaged or lost data** and I won't be able to help, because I don't maintain this specific codebase anymore.

If you'd like to contribute or help with this project, please look [here](https://github.com/dvub/passmanrsim) at the rewritten version.
